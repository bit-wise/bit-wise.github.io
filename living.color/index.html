          <h1>Living Color</h1>
          Living Color explores the ideas of evolution and homeostasis. 
            With each pass, each intersection's color is sampled and applied as the color of a line drawn in one of eight directions from that intersection.
            There is also a 1/1000 chance of a random color being applied, which simulated a mutation.
            This results in the formation of groups and struggles for dominance on those group's boundaries.
