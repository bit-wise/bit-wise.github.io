          <h1>Line Weaver</h1>
                      Line Weaver explores the idea of complexity from simplicity.
            With each pass, a random point is choosen on one of the four edges of the screen and a line is drawn to the other side.
            The only rule is that, if the line, as it is drawn, encounters another line, it toggles it's broken state.
            Imagine drawning a line and if you encounter another line, you lift your pen, then if encountering another you drawn again.
            This results in a highly complex pattern only possible by iteration.
