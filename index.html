            Living Color explores the ideas of evolution and homeostasis. 
            With each pass, each intersection's color is sampled and applied as the color of a line drawn in one of eight directions from that intersection.
            There is also a 1/1000 chance of a random color being applied, which simulated a mutation.
            This results in the formation of groups and struggles for dominance on those group's boundaries.

            Line Weaver explores the idea of complexity from simplicity.
            With each pass, a random point is choosen on one of the four edges of the screen and a line is drawn to the other side.
            The only rule is that, if the line, as it is drawn, encounters another line, it toggles it's broken state.
            Imagine drawning a line and if you encounter another line, you lift your pen, then if encountering another you drawn again.
            This results in a highly complex pattern only possible by iteration.
